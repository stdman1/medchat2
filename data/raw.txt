# Comprehensive Comparison of Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Combinations

ABC/3TC advantages include coformulation with DTG and availability of generic formulations for ABC/3TC, ABC, and 3TC. However, ABC/3TC may cause life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions in people who test positive for the HLA-B*5701 allele, requiring HLA-B*5701 testing before use. In the ACTG 5202 study, patients with baseline HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL or greater showed inferior virologic responses when ABC/3TC was given with EFV or ATV/r as opposed to TDF/FTC, though this difference was not seen when ABC/3TC was used in combination with DTG. ABC use has been associated with cardiovascular disease and cardiac events in some, but not all, observational studies. TAF/FTC advantages include coformulation with BIC, DRV/c, EVG/c, or RPV, activity against HBV making it a recommended dual-NRTI option for patients with HBV/HIV coinfection, smaller decline in renal function and less proteinuria and smaller reductions in bone mineral density than TDF/FTC, approval for people with eGFR 30 mL/min or greater, and ability to be used in people with eGFR less than 30 mL/min and on chronic hemodialysis. The disadvantage of TAF/FTC relates to weight gain with TAF. TDF/3TC advantages include coformulation with DOR, availability of generic formulations for TDF, 3TC, or TDF/3TC, long-term clinical experience, and activity against HBV. TDF/3TC disadvantages include renal toxicity including proximal tubulopathy and acute or chronic renal insufficiency especially when combined with pharmacologic boosters, osteomalacia as a consequence of proximal tubulopathy, and decreased bone mineral density especially when combined with pharmacologic boosters. TDF/FTC shares similar advantages including activity against HBV and TDF association with lower lipid levels than TAF, but also shares the same renal and bone toxicity concerns as TDF/3TC. Single NRTI 3TC advantages include coformulation with DTG as single-tablet regimen and avoidance of potential toxicities associated with TDF, TAF, and ABC. However, DTG/3TC is not recommended for individuals with HIV RNA greater than 500,000 copies/mL, HBV coinfection unless on another HBV active drug, or in whom ART is to be started before the results of HIV genotypic resistance testing for reverse transcriptase or HBV testing are available.

# Detailed Assessment of INSTI-Based Regimen Components for Optimal Treatment Selection

BIC advantages include coformulation with TAF/FTC, higher barrier to resistance than EVG and RAL, and no food requirement. BIC disadvantages include oral absorption reduction by simultaneous administration with drugs or supplements containing polyvalent cations such as aluminum-, calcium-, or magnesium-containing antacids or supplements or multivitamin tablets with minerals, CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 substrate status creating potential for drugâ€“drug interactions though BIC is not a CYP3A4 inducer or inhibitor, and weight gain associated with INSTI use. DTG advantages include higher barrier to resistance than EVG or RAL, coformulation with ABC/3TC and 3TC as single-tablet regimen, no food requirement, minimal CYP3A4 interactions, and favorable lipid profile. DTG disadvantages include oral absorption reduction by simultaneous administration with drugs containing polyvalent cations, UGT1A1 substrate status creating potential for drug interactions, depression and suicidal ideation though rare and usually in people with preexisting psychiatric conditions, and weight gain associated with INSTI use. EVG/c advantages include coformulation with TDF/FTC or TAF/FTC, smaller increases in total and LDL cholesterol compared with ATV/r, and ability for EVG/c/TAF/FTC to be used in patients on chronic hemodialysis. EVG/c disadvantages include recommendation only for patients with baseline CrCl 70 mL/min or greater with discontinuation required if CrCl decreases to less than 50 mL/min, COBI being a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor resulting in significant interactions with CYP3A substrates, oral absorption reduction by simultaneous administration with drugs containing polyvalent cations, COBI inhibition of active tubular secretion of creatinine increasing serum creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function, lower barrier to resistance than boosted PI-, BIC-, or DTG-based regimens, food requirement, depression and suicidal ideation though rare, avoidance in pregnancy due to lower levels of COBI and its boosted drugs in the second and third trimesters, and weight gain related to INSTIs. RAL advantages include longest post-marketing experience compared to other INSTIs, no food requirement, no CYP3A4 interactions, and favorable lipid profile. RAL disadvantages include lower barrier to resistance than boosted PI-, BIC-, or DTG-based regimens, increases in creatine kinase with myopathy and rhabdomyolysis reported, rare cases of severe hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, higher pill burden than other INSTI-based regimens, no fixed-dose combination formulation, oral absorption reduction by polyvalent cations, UGT1A1 substrate status creating drug interaction potential, depression and suicidal ideation though rare, and weight gain related to INSTIs.

# NNRTI Component Analysis for Specialized Treatment Scenarios

DOR advantages include coformulation with TDF/3TC, fewer CNS side effects compared to EFV and RPV, no food requirement, and coformulation with TAF/FTC. DOR disadvantages include shorter-term clinical experience than with RPV, potential for CYP450 drug interactions, and treatment-emergent DOR resistance mutations that may confer resistance to certain NNRTIs. EFV advantages include coformulation as EFV 600 mg with TDF/FTC and TDF/3TC and EFV 400 mg with TDF/3TC, long-term clinical experience with EFV 600-mg dose and well-documented efficacy of EFV-based regimens except for EFV plus ABC/3TC in patients with high HIV RNA, fewer CNS side effects with EFV 400 mg than EFV 600 mg, and ability for EFV 600 mg to be given with rifamycin antibiotics including rifampin, rifabutin, or rifapentine. EFV disadvantages include short- and long-term neuropsychiatric CNS side effects including depression and in some studies suicidality and catatonia with late-onset ataxia and encephalopathy also reported, need for periodic screening for depression and suicidality in people with HIV taking EFV-containing regimens, dyslipidemia, rash, QTc interval prolongation requiring consideration of alternatives in patients taking medications with known risk of causing Torsades de Pointes or those at higher risk, transmitted resistance being more common than with PIs and INSTIs, greater risk of resistance at treatment failure than with PIs, potential for CYP450 drug interactions, and requirement to be taken on an empty stomach as food increases drug absorption and CNS toxicities. RPV advantages include coformulation with TAF/FTC. RPV disadvantages include non-recommendation in people with pre-ART HIV RNA greater than 100,000 copies/mL or CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3 due to higher rate of virologic failure, depression and suicidality, QTc interval prolongation requiring consideration of alternatives in people taking medications with known risk of causing Torsades de Pointes, rash, transmitted resistance being more common than with PIs and INSTIs, more NNRTI-, TDF-, and 3TC-associated mutations at virologic failure than with regimens containing EFV and two NRTIs, potential for CYP450 drug interactions, meal requirement of greater than 390 kcal, requirement for acid for adequate absorption, contraindication with PPIs, and caution required with H2 antagonists or antacids.

# Comprehensive Evaluation of PI-Based Regimen Benefits and Limitations

ATV/c or ATV/r advantages include higher barrier to resistance than NNRTIs, EVG, and RAL, uncommon PI resistance at treatment failure with PK-enhanced PIs, similar virologic activity and toxicity profiles between ATV/c and ATV/r, observational cohort studies finding no association between ATV and increased cardiovascular events risk unlike some other PIs, and availability of individual ATV and RTV components as generics. ATV/c or ATV/r disadvantages include commonly causing indirect hyperbilirubinemia which may manifest as scleral icterus or jaundice, food requirement, absorption dependence on food and low gastric pH requiring careful management of interactions with H2 antagonists, antacids, and PPIs, nephrolithiasis, cholelithiasis, and nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal adverse effects, and CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate status creating potential for drug interactions. ATV/c specific considerations include advantages of coformulated tablet availability, but disadvantages include COBI inhibition of active tubular secretion of creatinine increasing serum creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function, non-recommendation of coadministration with TDF in patients with CrCl less than 70 mL/min, COBI being a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor like RTV resulting in significant interactions with CYP3A substrates, and COBI avoidance in pregnancy due to lower levels of COBI and its boosted drugs in the second and third trimesters requiring frequent viral load monitoring if pregnant women with suppressed virus on ATV/c elect to continue. DRV/c or DRV/r advantages include higher barrier to resistance than NNRTIs and uncommon PI resistance at treatment failure with PK-enhanced PIs. DRV/c or DRV/r disadvantages include skin rash, food requirement, gastrointestinal adverse effects, CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate status creating drug interaction potential, increased cardiovascular risk reported in one observational cohort study, and hepatotoxicity especially in those with preexisting liver disease. DRV/c specific considerations include advantages of coformulation as DRV/c and DRV/c/TAF/FTC, but disadvantages include COBI inhibition of active tubular secretion of creatinine, non-recommendation of coadministration with TDF in people with CrCl less than 70 mL/min, COBI being a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor resulting in significant CYP3A substrate interactions, and COBI avoidance in pregnancy due to lower drug levels in the second and third trimesters requiring frequent viral load monitoring if pregnant women with suppressed virus elect to continue DRV/c.

# Strategic Selection Criteria for Optimal HIV Treatment Individualization

The comprehensive advantages and disadvantages of antiretroviral components provide critical guidance for individualized treatment selection based on patient-specific factors. NRTI backbone selection should consider renal function with TAF/FTC preferred over TDF-containing regimens when renal or bone concerns exist, HLA-B*5701 testing mandatory before ABC use, and HBV coinfection status requiring HBV-active combinations. INSTI selection should prioritize second-generation agents BIC and DTG for their superior resistance barriers, with consideration of drug interaction potential being lower for DTG than BIC, polyvalent cation timing requirements for all INSTIs, and weight gain potential across the class. NNRTI use should be reserved for specific scenarios where INSTI or PI regimens are not suitable, with DOR having fewer drug interactions and CNS effects than other options, RPV requiring specific viral load and CD4 criteria, and all NNRTIs having lower resistance barriers than INSTIs or PIs. PI selection should focus on boosted DRV as the preferred option when high resistance barrier is needed, with consideration of significant drug interaction potential due to CYP3A4 inhibition, pregnancy compatibility favoring RTV over COBI boosting, and renal function requirements for COBI-boosted regimens. Clinical decision-making should integrate these component characteristics with individual patient factors including comorbidities, concomitant medications, pregnancy status or potential, HBV coinfection, baseline viral load and CD4 count, prior treatment history including PrEP exposure, adherence patterns, and patient preferences regarding pill burden, food requirements, and dosing frequency. The goal remains selection of the most appropriate regimen that maximizes efficacy while minimizing toxicity and drug interactions for each individual patient, utilizing the detailed advantages and disadvantages of each component to guide evidence-based treatment decisions that optimize long-term outcomes and quality of life.

# Tailored Component Selection for Special Populations and Monitoring Protocols

Special population considerations require careful evaluation of component advantages and disadvantages to optimize treatment outcomes. Pregnancy considerations necessitate avoiding COBI-boosted regimens due to reduced drug levels in second and third trimesters, favoring DTG over other INSTIs based on updated neural tube defect data, using proven regimens with extensive pregnancy experience, and ensuring adequate viral suppression to prevent perinatal transmission. Renal impairment management requires avoiding or dose-adjusting TDF-based regimens especially with boosters, considering TAF as preferred tenofovir formulation, evaluating creatinine clearance requirements for specific combinations like DRV/c with TDF requiring CrCl 70 mL/min or greater, and understanding that COBI and some INSTIs increase serum creatinine without affecting glomerular function. Hepatitis B coinfection necessitates using HBV-active regimens containing TAF, TDF, FTC, or 3TC, avoiding DTG/3TC unless additional HBV-active agent added, ensuring adequate HBV suppression to prevent flares, and coordinating with hepatology for comprehensive management. Cardiovascular risk assessment should consider ABC avoidance in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, monitoring lipid changes with PI use, evaluating QTc prolongation risk with EFV and RPV, and implementing appropriate cardiovascular risk reduction strategies. Drug interaction management requires comprehensive medication review before regimen selection, understanding CYP3A4 inhibition with all boosted regimens, considering acid-reducing agent interactions with RPV and boosted PIs, timing polyvalent cation administration with INSTIs, and utilizing drug interaction resources for complex polypharmacy situations. Monitoring protocols should include baseline and periodic assessment of renal function for TDF-containing regimens, bone density screening for TDF users, liver function monitoring for PI users especially with preexisting hepatitis, lipid monitoring for PI and EFV users, neuropsychiatric assessment for INSTI and NNRTI users, and cardiovascular risk evaluation for patients on regimens with known cardiovascular associations. These considerations ensure that component selection and monitoring are appropriately tailored to individual patient characteristics and risk factors, maximizing treatment success while minimizing potential adverse outcomes.
